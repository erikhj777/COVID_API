# COVID_API.py
These are series of scripts to pull and parse data from the COVID Act Now API.  Metrics for states of interest are redered in graphs using Seaborn module.

The VA_COVID19_tracking.py file pulls the latest case number data from the API, parses out the data for the state of VA and Arlington county
The WI_COVID19_tracking.py file does the same thing for the state of Wisconson
